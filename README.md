üí≥ Project Theta: Real-Time NBFC Fraud Detection System1. Project OverviewProject Theta is a production-ready Machine Learning system designed to detect high-risk and fraudulent transactions for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) in real-time. It addresses the critical need for low-latency, accurate fraud scoring by implementing a robust XGBoost classification model and deploying it via a high-speed FastAPI service.The project demonstrates a complete MLOps lifecycle, from data simulation and model training to API deployment and a dedicated GUI for analyst review.The ChallengeFraud losses require immediate action. Traditional systems often rely on batch processing or simple rules. Project Theta's solution provides a real-time risk score (under 50ms), allowing for instant decision-making.2. Core Features & ArchitectureKey ComponentsML Training (fraud_system.py): Trains an XGBoost Classifier on synthetic, highly imbalanced data. Handles class imbalance using scale_pos_weight.Real-Time API (api_service.py): A low-latency FastAPI endpoint for integrating the model into core payment processing systems.Hackathon Demo GUI (nbfc_fraud_gui.py): A simple Tkinter desktop application for manual testing and live demonstration of the risk scoring.Architecture FlowThe system operates in two main phases: Offline Training and Online Inference.Code snippetgraph TD

3. Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesYou must have Python 3.9+ installed.DependenciesInstall all required libraries using the following pip command:Bashpip install pandas numpy xgboost scikit-learn imblearn fastapi uvicorn pydantic joblib

4. Usage & Execution GuideFollow these three steps to run the complete system.Step 1: Train the Model (Required First)This script creates the models/ directory and saves the trained machine learning assets (.joblib files).Bashpython fraud_system.py

Expected Output:
         Displays model performance (AUC, Recall, Precision) and confirms: Model and Scaler saved to: models/.Step 2 (Option A): Run the Hackathon Demo GUI üíªUse this for your live demonstration to quickly show how the system makes a decision based on four input features.Bashpython nbfc_fraud_gui.py

5. Model and Decision LogicFeatures UsedThe model uses four key features, simulating real-time inputs:amounthour_of_day (Time-based feature)distance_from_last_tx (Geospatial/Behavioral feature)count_tx_1h (Velocity Feature from Mock Feature Store)3-Tier Decision EngineThe system uses a two-level threshold approach to move beyond simple binary (fraud/not-fraud) classification, providing nuanced operational decisions:
